<!-- paragraphe -->
An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus domestica). Apple trees are
cultivated worldwide and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central
Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and
mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit
frequently lacks desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto
rootstocks. Apple trees grown without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting.
Rootstocks are used to control the speed of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier
harvesting.

Cultivars

<!-- paragraphe -->
There are more than 7,500 known cultivars (cultivated varieties) of apples. Cultivars vary in their yield
and the ultimate size of the tree, even when grown on the same rootstock. Different cultivars are
available for temperate and subtropical climates. The UK's National Fruit Collection, which is the
responsibility of the Department of Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, includes a collection of over 2,000
cultivars of apple tree in Kent.
