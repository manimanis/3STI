    <h2>What is a computer?</h2>
    <p>A computer is a <strong>machine</strong> that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical
      operations automatically via <em>computer programming</em>. Modern computers have the ability to follow
      generalized sets of
      operations, called <strong>programs</strong>. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range
      of tasks.</p>
    <p>A "complete" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment
      required and used for "full" operation can be referred to as a <strong>computer system</strong>. This term may
      as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a <ins>computer
        network</ins> or <ins>computer cluster</ins>.</p>
